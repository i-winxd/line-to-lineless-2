# line-to-lineless-2
 
This is https://github.com/i-winxd/lined-to-lineless-art written in C++. Any description there
applies here.

USAGE: you must use this in the command line; clicking on the exe file does nothing.

Where:
- `<the executable file>` is the name of the executable
- `stroke.png` is the path to the stroke file
- `color.png` is the path to the color file
- `output.png` is what you want the output **png** file to be saved (this program will always export a PNG)

*Your input files must have transparency or this program will not work.*

For those who don't have experience with the command line, you should really learn it (at least, `cd`).

If the EXE file can't be found, then it is TBA

```
<the executable file> stroke.png color.png output.png
```
